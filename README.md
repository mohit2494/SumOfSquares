# SumOfSquares
An  interesting  problem  in  arithmetic  with  deep  implications  to elliptic curve theory is  the  problem  of  finding perfect  squares  that  are  sums of  consecutive squares. The goal of this first project is to use F# and the actor model to build a good solution to this problem that runs well on multi-core machines.
